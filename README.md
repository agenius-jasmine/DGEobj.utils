# DGEobj.utils # 

The DGEobj.utils package implements a limma/voom workflow capturing the results
in DGEobj data structure.  Aside from implementing a well developed and popular
workflow in DGEobj format, the run* functions in the package illustrate how to
wrap the individual processing steps in a workflow in functions that capture
important metadata, processing parameters and intermediate data items in the
final DGEobj data structure.  This function based approach to utilizing the
DGEobj data structure insures consistency among a collection of projects
processed by these methods and thus facilitates downstreak automated
meta-analysis.
